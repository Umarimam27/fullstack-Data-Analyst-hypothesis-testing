# 📊 Sales Data Analysis & Hypothesis Testing

This project explores **statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and data visualization** on a synthetic **Sales Dataset** using Python. The goal is to demonstrate how descriptive and inferential statistics can uncover insights from data, and how visualizations can make those insights more intuitive.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview
- Generated a synthetic **Sales Dataset** with product details, categories, units sold, and dates.  
- Performed **descriptive statistics** (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation).  
- Conducted **inferential statistics** including confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.  
- Built multiple **visualizations** (histograms, boxplots, bar plots, heatmaps, 3D scatter plots, treemaps, etc.) to understand sales trends.  
- Implemented a basic **Streamlit app** (`app.py`) as a starting point for interactive dashboards.  
- Created an **explainer video** to showcase the hypothesis testing process.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Squarify)  
- **Statistics** (Hypothesis Testing, ANOVA, Regression Errors – MAE, MSE, RMSE)  
- **Visualization** (2D/3D plots, pairplots, violin plots, KDE, treemap, heatmaps)  
- **Streamlit** (for interactive app development)

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Average units sold ≈ **18.8** (Median = 18.5, Mode = 17).  
- Highest sales variation seen in the **Home** category.  
- **Hypothesis Test Result**: Failed to reject the null hypothesis (mean units sold not significantly different from 20).  
- Visual analysis revealed clear category-based patterns and trends over time.

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Expand the Streamlit app to include all visualizations & interactive filters.  
- Add machine learning models for **sales prediction & forecasting**.  
- Deploy the app on **Streamlit Cloud / Hugging Face Spaces**.

---

## 📽️ Demo
A short video has been included to demonstrate the **Hypothesis Testing workflow** and analysis steps.

👉 This project shows how **full-stack data science concepts** — from statistics to visualization and deployment — can be applied to extract actionable insights from sales data.
